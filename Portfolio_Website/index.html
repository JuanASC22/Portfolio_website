//hello
    <p class="about_me_paragraph">My name is Juan Davila. 
        <p class="about_me_paragraph">I'm a 17 year old who is currently learning coding and 3D modeling. 
        Before now, I was doing music as a hobby and have since gained 3 years of expierence. 
        I still compose on occasion and have created around 40 songs. </p>
        <p class="about_me_paragraph">When it comes to coding, 
        I have learned much from a 6 week coding intensive called "all star code" 
        and have made various projects in my own time. I have (insert here) games.
        When it comes to 3D Modeling, 
        I have (insert here) models, some of which you will see in my games
